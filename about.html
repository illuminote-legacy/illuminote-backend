  <h1>Our Origin</h1>
  <p>Founded in the shadows of the 18th century by Lucien Aucherilum, a disciple of arcane wisdom and forgotten harmonics, Illuminote began as a cultural resistance—an echo of the forbidden.</p>
  <p>Today, we are a strategic powerhouse with reach in music, tech, finance, mentorship, neurodesign and luxury markets. Our creed—"Where Legacy Isn’t Given. It’s Engineered."—defines our global expansion.</p>
